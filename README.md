# Documentation
If you want to add more blips than in the configuration file, simply follow the example below:

```
Config.Blip = {
    [1] = {
        label = "Blip 1",
        coords = vec3(-1039.91, -2731.21, 20.21),
        sprite = 66,
        scale = 0.6,
        colour = 0,
        asshortrange = true
    },
    [2] = {
        label = "Blip 2",
        coords = vec3(-1000.91, -2731.21, 20.21),
        sprite = 66,
        scale = 0.6,
        colour = 0,
        asshortrange = true
    },
    [3] = {
        label = "Blip 3",
        coords = vector3(340.19, 5563.89, 624.67),
        sprite = 66,
        scale = 0.6,
        colour = 0,
        asshortrange = true
    }
}
```
